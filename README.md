It's actually a code written in reactjs which is a javascript library used for frontend developement.

 In order to run this project first of all install the 'Node modules required for this project'. Now for installing Node modules first of all open the root directory in 'VS Code' such as  'fakestoreAPI_EcommerceSite'. Then open the terminal in 'VS Code' and run the command 'npm install', this command would install all the dependencies listed in package.json file.
 

 Now once the Node modules installed, then run the command 'npm start run' in the terminal

 The project would open in this way in the browser and then you can evaluate my performance

 I’ve incorporated several features into the project, including real-time product search such as user types in the search bar and items appears below accordingly, the project has price filtering, and category filtering features also. The price filter offers three options in a dropdown menu: 'Equal To', 'Greater Than', and 'Lesser Than'. When you select 'Equal To' and enter a price, the site will search the database for products that exactly match that price and display them. The 'Greater Than' and 'Lesser Than' options display products which has greater or lesser price than the price you entered in textarea. The category filter allows users to display products within a specific category. Additionally, these filters can be combined—for instance, you can search for "men's clothing" and further refine the results by price, ensuring only products within that category and price range are displayed.

 The project also features a sorting mechanism that allows products to be sorted by price in either ascending or descending order. Additionally, it can sort products alphabetically based on their category names.

 The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, whether you're using a mobile device, laptop, or desktop, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

 The website is perfect, it fullfills all the requirements. Hopefully, you would like it.

 For this project, I utilized Context API, along with useState, useEffect, and useRef. While Redux Toolkit could have been an option, I chose Context API because this isn't a large project. Redux Toolkit is generally preferred for larger projects where efficient state management is more critical.

 For decoration and designing purpose I have used TailwindCss

 I have hosted this application on Netlify and also send you it's link on your email
